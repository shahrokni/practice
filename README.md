# Web Essentials HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Think of **_HTML_** as the **bricks** that form the foundation and structure of a webpage. Each HTML element is like an individual brick, contributing to the overall layout.

**_CSS_** is like the **plaster** and paint, **_styling and arranging_** the bricks to look appealing.

**_JavaScript_** is like electrical **wiring**, bringing **_interactivity_** and **_functionality_**.

HTML is nested and hierarchical, just like a tree structure or a family tree. Each element can have parent, child, and sibling relationships.

# Is that all ?!

**Nope!** It is necessary to comprehend **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, but it is not enough! Although you can start fast and develop small applications, for real, production-level applications your toolbox should be full of useful tools!

## The FE Engineering journey

- Html, CSS, javaScript, TypeScript
- Browsers, their strengths and limitations
- At least on Modern framework and tools (React, Angular, Vue, NPM, Babel, Yarn, Node, etc)
- Network and network security knowledge (HTTP, REST, Web-attacks, etc)
- Software engineering knowledge (OOP, Design patterns, Micro-FE, etc)
- WASM (**Optional**)
- **patience!**

## Why should I know FE?!

FE gives you the chance to materialize your innovative and brilliant ideas! You can get rid of the stupid black and white console and see the fruit of your strive! Besides, You understand Mahmoud!

## Are FE, JS, TS skyrocket?!

**No**, not at all. I personally think initially they were designed for dumb people, so no worries! If you can not understand them at the moment, its because either you are not interested, or you are too lazy! :|

**HOWEVER,**

Although, JS is a powerful programming language, and you can even develop high-quality 3D games with it, you should understand:

1- Initially JS was designed to swallow errors or fix them automatically on behalf of developers!!! This is on of the reasons the behavior of language may look odd!

2- JS is a **single-thread** programming language, and it's instructions are executed with a kind of **JIT** mechanism. This means you **CAN NOT** develop **resource-exhaustive or real-time applications** with it. For achieving such goals you need to mix the language with more advanced topics like **WASM**.

# The fastest way I can start?

Create the following files and you can start

- index.html : Put your raw structure here
- style.css : Make your raw structure pretty
- index.js : Add dynamics to your application

# Task 1

Open the 3 mentioned files and try to find a rational or logical relationship between them? (Html and CSS are design to be self-describing)

- Run the app first. Play with it.
- How can you explain the relationship between theses three and where would be the confluence point here?

# Task 2

Look at the html file one more time. It looks like a nested, hierarchical structure. Any clue?

# Task 3

Be more curious!

- What are `p` or `div` in the HTML file?
- What other tags do we have in the HTML world?
- Why can't I use `div` instead of `p`, if I can use them interchangeably? any clue?
- What is `id`? Why is it important? (You can take a look at the JS and CSS files)
- Should I know all the tags in the world? (No)

# CSS

- Element, id, and Classes
- Fixed-size instead of dynamic size
- Why it may give you a headache (differed styles from different points)
- Why it may give you a headache (The effect of higher elements)
- Can it be optimized to avoid redundancy? (Yes but be careful)
- Children play with CSS, but only big boys comprehend it!
- May take years to become a CSS master!
- These days pure css is rarely used. For example, here we use something called styled-component. (You can contribute now!)

# Task 4

- Try to understand the flow of the JS file. Can you explain it?
- Where should I call `setUp` function? Does it really matter?
- Let's discuss setUp, addKeyBoardUI
- Try to find out how my app is sensitive to keyboard key-press. addKeyPressHandler
- Solve the bug (Backspace)
- Add a feature (Mouse click)
